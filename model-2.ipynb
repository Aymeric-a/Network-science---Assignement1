    "## Assignment objective: \n",
    "- show empirically how close to expectation the real network generated from the White Helmets dataset is compared to a baseline model\n",
    "- compare the characteristics of the network extracted from the White Helmets dataset described in the first lecture with the expected characteristics of a “regular” network generated using some classical network generation models.\n",
    "- Choose and justify your choice for at least 5 network metrics\n",
    "- Choose at least two generative network models to compare against. Justify your choice. \n",
    "- Via empirical evaluation, make the case that the network structures from the White Helmets dataset are expected/unexpected (with an attempt to distinguish between organic and coordinated behaviour)\n",
    "\n",
    "## Dataset\n",
    "- The dataset has the following format:\n",
    "<videoID>, <userID_1>, <userID_2>, <timestamp_1>, <timestamp_2>\n",
    "- where the posts by userID_1 and userID_2 are within 52 seconds of each others and both contain a link to the same videoID. \n",
    "- timestamp_1 is the time when userID_1 posted the url to videoID, timestamp_2 is the time when userID_2 posted the same url.\n",

    "### Reason for comparing real networks with random networks:\n",
    "Comparing two complete different types of random/baseline networks with the real network to see which structures and properties in the real network are not random.\n",
    "- Which properties of the real network are statistically significant and which properties are occurring also in random networks\n",
    "- If a real network, for example, has a much higher clustering than a random network of the same density → indication of community structures or local organization.\n",
    "- Evaluating the benefits of a real network in comparison to a random network\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chosen random networks:\n",
    "- Watts-Strogatz graph/Small world -> low average path length and high Clustering coefficient -> random restructuring of edges\n",
    "- Barabasi-Albert model -> Scale-free network -> Creating Hub -> More connections/edges\n",
    "\n",
    "## Metrics:\n",
    "\n",
    "### Chosen metrics and reasons for choosing theses metrics:\n",
    "- Clustering Coefficient\n",
    "    → Measures how likely it is that two neighbors of a node are also connected.\n",
    "    Rationale: Coordinated campaigns often form tightly connected groups that amplify similar narratives. Random networks usually have low clustering, so higher values indicate non-random coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Modularity\n",
    "    → Quantifies the presence of distinct communities within the network.\n",
    "    Rationale: Influence operations typically involve groups of accounts promoting similar messages. High modularity compared to a random baseline suggests organized, topic-based coordination.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Degree Assortativity\n",
    "    → Captures whether nodes of similar degree tend to connect with each other.\n",
    "    Rationale: Coordinated networks often display unusual degree correlations (e.g., central “hub” accounts linked to many smaller ones). Deviations from randomness reveal hierarchical or controlled connectivity.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Betweenness Centrality\n",
    "    → Measures how frequently a node appears on the shortest paths between others.\n",
    "    Rationale: Cross-platform actors who bridge YouTube, Twitter, and Facebook tend to have high betweenness. This highlights key agents coordinating dissemination across platforms.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Degree Distribution\n",
    "    → Describes how many links each node has.\n",
    "    Rationale: Random networks tend to have homogeneous degree patterns. Real disinformation networks often exhibit heavy-tailed distributions with dominant hubs — evidence of intentional amplification.\n",
