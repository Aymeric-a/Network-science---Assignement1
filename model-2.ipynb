    "- show empirically how close to expectation the real network generated from the White Helmets dataset is compared to a baseline model\n",
    "- compare the characteristics of the network extracted from the White Helmets dataset described in the first lecture with the expected characteristics of a “regular” network generated using some classical network generation models.\n",
    "- Choose and justify your choice for at least 5 network metrics\n",
    "- Choose at least two generative network models to compare against. Justify your choice. \n",
    "- Via empirical evaluation, make the case that the network structures from the White Helmets dataset are expected/unexpected (with an attempt to distinguish between organic and coordinated behaviour)\n",

    "## Dataset\n",
    "- The dataset has the following format:\n",
    "<videoID>, <userID_1>, <userID_2>, <timestamp_1>, <timestamp_2>\n",
    "- where the posts by userID_1 and userID_2 are within 52 seconds of each others and both contain a link to the same videoID. \n",
    "- timestamp_1 is the time when userID_1 posted the url to videoID, timestamp_2 is the time when userID_2 posted the same url.\n",

    "Comparing two complete different types of random/baseline networks with the real network to see which structures and properties in the real network are not random.\n",

    "- Watts-Strogatz graph/Small world -> ow average average path length and Clustering coefficient -> random restructuring of edges\n",
